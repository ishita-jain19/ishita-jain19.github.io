Let's delve into a day etched in my memory, a chapter from when I was around 10 years old, battling a month-long struggle with a urinary infection and Typhoid that left me weakened, with persistent fever and troubling symptoms. :( This health ordeal unfolded during a holiday, amidst a wedding celebration, and coincided with my long, painstaking effort to grow and maintain healthy hair locks. <3

As the infections took a toll on my body, internal weakness set in, leading to weight loss and severe hair fall. On a particular day, my grandmother, who was a constant source of support during those challenging times, delicately oiled and neatly tied my hair into two braids, offering me with both comfort and a way to minimize hair breakage.

Sitting on the ground, her wise words resonated as she shared, "I understand your dedication to your long, beautiful hair, but considering your current health situation, it might be wise to cut them short. Let your body recover fully, and you can grow them again later when you're stronger." The notion of parting with my cherished tresses saddened me; tears welled up, and I sought solace in sharing my distress with my mum.

Understanding my emotional turmoil, my mum gently encouraged me to reflect on it when I felt better and make a decision. Eventually, I realized that the advice, though hard to accept initially, stemmed from genuine concern for my well-being. Acknowledging the importance of health over hair, I made the decision to get a haircut. :)


What Did I Learn from this Day?

- Elders offer wisdom based on experience; their advice may not always align with our desires, but it often carries profound insights for our well-being.
- Challenging times may bring pain and unpleasant memories, yet seeking the silver lining and understanding that future goodness may emerge is crucial. In my case, the health challenges paved the way for a transformative healing journey.
- The unconditional love of our grandparents and parents remains a priceless source of comfort and support. <3

Once my grandmother finished braiding my hair, my dad captured a picture, now preserved in one of our family photo albums, encapsulating a moment of resilience and the beginning of a healing chapter. <3 <3
