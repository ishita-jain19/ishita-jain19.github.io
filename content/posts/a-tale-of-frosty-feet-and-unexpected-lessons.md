Today, I reminisce about a day from our family trip to Darjeeling, a journey embarked upon when I was around 9 years old, accompanied by a delightful group of family friends. This adventure, etched in my childhood memories, has become a cornerstone of my passion for travel ‚Äî a gift from my parents that I am forever grateful for. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è

We ventured into Darjeeling during the December holidays, immersing ourselves in the freezing cold of a region unaccustomed to winters. For a kid from a part of India who doesn't typically experience such cold, the trip was a thrilling and occasionally daunting experience. üò≤

The day I want to share revolves around our plan to visit Tiger Hill early in the morning, eager to witness the captivating sunrise over the Kanchenjunga range and the snow-clad peaks of the eastern Himalayas. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è To brave the cold, we bundled up in winter body suits, anticipating the chilly adventure that awaited us.

Despite our meticulous preparation, there was one underestimated factor‚Äîproper footwear. I adorned two socks and a cotton footwear, and the memory of that day isn't dominated by the breathtaking sunrise but rather by my freezing feet, toes succumbing to frostbite. It was a moment that dampened the experience, not only for me but also for my concerned mum.

A local, driving us around, noticed the discomfort and advised my mum to head to a good shoe shop for winter boots. This incident served as a lesson learned for future travels, especially considering our upcoming visit to Gangtok, where snow might be in the forecast.

What did I learn from this day?

- Preparation is key, especially when venturing into places with extreme temperatures or unfamiliar weather conditions. (No blame on my mum, as back in those days, information wasn't as readily accessible.)
- Not every journey to a breathtaking place guarantees a perfect and awe-inspiring moment. Unexpected circumstances can alter our expectations. Take a breath, acknowledge it's okay, and remember that experiences can be recreated. ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Regardless of disappointments or unmet expectations, parents always prioritize their children. ‚ù§Ô∏è


This day, with its blend of sweetness and bitterness, prompted me to plan with caution for our snowy adventures in Japan last year. üòÑ
