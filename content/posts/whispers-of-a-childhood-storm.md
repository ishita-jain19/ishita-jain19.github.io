So the day I'm going to talk about today goes back to when I was around 3 to 4 years old. While I don't have this day etched in my own memory, the vivid recount from my mum and dad paints a picture. ❤️❤️

During that time, my dad was on a field assignment where they camped in tents for 14 days before returning home for the next 14 days. On one such occasion, he took my mum and me to experience tent living. Although I can't recall the sensations, I've seen pictures and heard stories that make this day stand out.😊

This particular day featured a massive storm with thunderstorms, fierce winds, and heavy rain. Everyone was instructed to stay inside the sturdy tents, yet, despite their construction, they were still tents, and the experience of being inside during a storm was likely daunting. According to my mum, I was so frightened by the tumultuous events that I nearly fainted. They did their best to keep me occupied amidst the chaos. I was genuinely terrified by the noise and the tent's movement caused by the gusty winds outside.😢

While I might not remember this incident personally, my parents have recounted it several times, leaving me intrigued about the actual experience.😌


What did I learn from this day?

- Early childhood experiences, especially those involving fear, can have a lasting impact, even if you don't recall them firsthand. I, too, still feel a bit uneasy and insecure during thunderstorms, despite not remembering this incident. 😟
- Parents play a crucial role in exposing you to life events, as my dad introduced me to tent living even at such a young age, ensuring both a novel experience and my safety during challenging situations. ❤️❤️
