Durga Puja, a grand and auspicious festival in the heart of Kolkata, holds a special place in my childhood memories. The 10-day celebration is filled with joy, festivities, and a vibrant atmosphere.ðŸŽ‰

On a particular night during Durga Puja, some of our family friends along with my family decided to embark on a pandal-hopping adventure. Pandal hopping is a cherished tradition during these festivities, where beautifully crafted temporary structures (pandals) showcase artistic representations of Goddess Durga.ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒŸ

Our journey began around 10 pm, right after dinner, and continued until the early hours of the morning, around 2 or 3 am. Despite the bustling crowds and the timeless nature of the experience, the feeling of exploring these artistic and divine pandals was truly enchanting and has remained etched in my heart.ðŸ’–

What did I learn from this day?

- The cultural and spiritual richness of festivals can create lasting memories and a profound sense of connection.
- Embracing traditions and sharing them with loved ones enhances the joy and significance of celebrations.
- Sometimes, the most magical moments happen when you immerse yourself in the cultural tapestry of your surroundings.âœ¨
