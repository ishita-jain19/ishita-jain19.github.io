The day I want to share today is post my move to Singapore. After settling down in Singapore following my marriage, about four months later, my husband and I planned a short trip to Melaka, a city in Malaysia approximately 4 hours away by road. This plan coincided with the Christmas holidays, and I was filled with excitement as it marked my first visit to a new country, the fourth overall, including India and Singapore. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è

This day was when we were supposed to embark on this journey, taking an evening bus after finishing our work, to reach the hotel around midnight. Being inexperienced travelers, and this being our first trip, we were starving by the time we reached the hotel. Since we had chosen a small boutique hotel outside the main town to save money while settling in Singapore, there were no open eateries nearby, and the hotel lacked a kitchen for us to order food. After freshening up, we went downstairs hoping to find a store for a quick bite before calling it a night. üòä

My excitement peaked when I spotted a street food van in Malaysia, a sight I hadn't seen for 4 to 5 months since moving out of India to Singapore. Additionally, there was a 24-hour convenience store nearby. üòä We approached the food van, and to our dismay, it was a burger vendor using ham in the burgers. Being a pure vegetarian from India, it felt awkward to stand there and ask the person to just heat the burger bun with butter separately, especially when he was still using the same pan to heat the ham. My husband, feeling hungry and practical, suggested we go ahead with it, but I refused, saying I couldn't eat it after witnessing the process. Disagreement ensued, turning into a hangry (hungry + angry) argument. Eventually, we both decided not to eat the bun, quietly went to the store, and managed to get only milk for that moment. üòî 
Back in the room, I sipped some milk and went to sleep, while my husband, in his anger, chose to sleep on an empty stomach. üòî

What did I learn this day?

- Sometimes, we really need to think logically and out of the box to make things work. We always cannot just stay very strict on our beliefs and also expect to have a good time without any trouble.
- Sometimes, a day full of excitement and happiness can turn into a not-so-happy day or a sad day; however, it is up to us how to learn from such days and remember that day in our memories.
- Days like this can give you some lessons that we can try to use and follow in the future.


That was one day and some learning that led us to travel to 20-plus countries together and experience amazing things while still being vegetarian and just being a bit more flexible with each other. That was a day that made me learn and be prepared for future travels if we come across such situations in a country that we are not so much aware of. Lastly, we took this day as a beautiful learning and a memory that we now look back, laugh, and always talk about. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
