On this poignant day in 2021, amid the tumultuous peak of Covid phase 2, the world grappled with the devastating impacts of the pandemic. Trapped under strict lockdowns and sealed country borders, I found myself in Singapore, far from my loved ones in India.😰

As distressing news flooded my social media and news feeds, my concern for my parents, alone in India amidst the chaos, soared. The shortage of oxygen cylinders and hospital beds added to the panic, intensifying my fears for their well-being.😢

Overwhelmed by the relentless worry, I became trapped in a cycle of overthinking, constantly checking on my parents, and being on call with them. 

One fateful night, as I sought solace in sleep, an unexpected wave of unease gripped me. Breathing became a struggle, my heart raced, and the weight on my chest was suffocating.😰

Terrified, I confided in my husband, who patiently helped me navigate through the storm of emotions, granting me the solace needed to finally drift into sleep. The unsettling experience recurred in the days that followed, prompting a search for answers.🌙

Upon consulting my doctor cousin and scouring through online resources, the diagnosis was clear — Anxiety attack. The revelation prompted immediate action; I severed ties with distressing news on social media, opting instead for regular conversations with my parents.📱

In the ensuing days, my condition improved, but the memory of that initial night lingered—a stark reminder of the debilitating impact of anxiety disorders.😢


What did I learn from this day?

- Recognizing the toll constant worry can take on mental health is crucial. Taking steps to shield oneself from distressing information is a form of self-preservation.🛡️
- Regularly checking in on loved ones fosters a sense of connection and reassurance, helping alleviate anxiety.❤️
- Consulting a healthcare professional, even a family member, can provide valuable insights and guidance during challenging times.👩‍⚕️


This day, etched in my memory, serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of mental well-being and the importance of proactive self-care.❤️😢
