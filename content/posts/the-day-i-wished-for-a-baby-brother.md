This day I fondly remember holds a special place in my heart. 

Around the age of 4, I visited a friend who had just welcomed a baby brother. Witnessing her sheer joy and playing with the little one left a lasting impression on me. From that moment, a desire took root – I longed for a baby brother of my own.

Excitedly, I shared my wish with my mother, proposing a visit to the hospital to surprise my dad, who was away at the time. However, my mother wisely explained that it wasn't as simple as that. If I genuinely wanted a baby brother, she advised me to be a good girl and earnestly pray to God every day for his blessing. ❤️❤️

What did I learn that day?
- Even at the tender age of 4, I grasped the joy that babies bring, and the profound love and happiness they infuse into our lives.
- The importance of sincere prayer when we truly desire something from our hearts. 😇

Reflecting on that day, I am immensely grateful for that innocent longing that led me to pester my parents. 💕 This desire became a driving force in my life until the day I finally welcomed my baby brother into the world – an experience that remains the happiest moment of my life. 😇❤️
