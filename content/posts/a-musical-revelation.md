Today, let me reminisce about a childhood memory when I embarked on the journey of learning classical singing. It was a day that marked a pivotal moment in my musical endeavors.

After a few classes with a talented teacher who played the harmonium, my friend and I, the two eager students, were absorbed in the world of musical notes. However, my friend excelled, showcasing a natural aptitude, while my own progress fell short of expectations.😞

On this particular day, I sat down for a rigorous rehearsal of 'Sa re Ga ma pa,' enduring a half-hour session with my teacher. Despite my sincere efforts, my notes failed to meet her standards. She questioned my commitment, asking if I was genuinely interested or merely attending because of my mother's insistence. With a heavy heart, I admitted my struggle and lack of passion for the art.😔

Disheartened but understanding, my teacher encouraged me to give it a few more attempts. Yet, by the end of that day, we collectively decided that classical singing might not be my forte at that moment.😅


What did I learn from this day?

- Exploring various interests is crucial in discovering one's true passions and strengths.
- Gratitude fills me when I recall my teacher's discernment, guiding me to communicate openly with my mother about my true feelings. ❤️
- Always express your preferences and concerns, fostering open communication with parents and teachers. It ensures that your energy is invested in endeavors that align with your genuine interests.😊😊
