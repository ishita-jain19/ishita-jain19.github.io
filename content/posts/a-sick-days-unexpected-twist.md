Today, I'm eager to share a delightful incident from this morning's breakfast that kept me smiling throughout the day.

Last night, my daughter fell ill, developing a fever that persisted till morning. Recognizing her discomfort, my husband and I decided to let her rest and skip school for the day. Although she was enthusiastic about the upcoming Chinese New Year celebration at school, featuring her dance performance, we believed a day off would do her good.

During breakfast, I gently inquired about her well-being and expressed regret that she couldn't attend school. Responding with a frown, she admitted feeling sad about missing the final rehearsal for the dance. Seizing the moment, I playfully informed her about the Mandarin spelling test she also skipped. 😊

To our surprise, her eyes sparkled with joy, and she broke into a happy dance, exclaiming how thrilled she was to avoid the spelling test she had forgotten about. Both my husband and I burst into laughter, charmed by the innocence and exuberance in her reaction. ❤️ 😜

Throughout the day, whenever she spoke to family members, her opening line was a cheerful announcement about being sick yesterday, leading to a day of rest today. The cherry on top was her gleeful realization that she escaped the spelling test. 😜 😊 ❤️

What did I learn from this day?

- Cherishing these small, spontaneous moments adds a layer of joy to our lives and creates enduring memories.
- Witnessing a 7-year-old turning a sick day into a happy one by celebrating the avoidance of a spelling test was a heartwarming reminder of the simplicity of childhood joy. 😊 ❤️
