In my tender years, around the age of 4 or 5, the anticipation of my aunt's (my mum's younger sister) visit filled me with excitement. She was unmarried and young, making her visits particularly special as I looked forward to the pampering and quality time we'd share. ❤️😇

Prior to her arrival, my mum prepared the guest room. Given our recent move to a new city and the absence of an extra bed, we borrowed a single bed from our thoughtful neighbors. Secretly, my mum cautioned me not to reveal this arrangement to my aunt upon her arrival. 😌

The awaited day arrived, and my excitement peaked as I warmly welcomed her. After showing her around, I suggested we both crawl beneath the borrowed bed. Thankfully, her youth and slender frame allowed her to join me in this delightful hiding spot beneath the bed. 😆😍 
It was there that I confessed, "Mausi(Aunt), since we didn't have an extra bed for you, we borrowed this one from our neighbor."

To my surprise, she smiled and embraced me, expressing gratitude for making her feel at home. ❤️ Our shared moment beneath the bed remains etched in my heart, creating a lasting memory that brings a smile whenever I think of her to this day. ❤️❤️

What did I learn that day:

1. The astonishing innocence and purity of a small child's heart, where honesty and sharing extend to what they perhaps shouldn't disclose.
2. The profound bond we share with family, as we strive to make them feel happy, welcomed, and comfortable without expecting anything in return.
3. The beautiful blessing of having neighbors and a community always ready to lend a helping hand when needed.

In reflecting upon days like these, filled with innocence and warmth, I'm reminded that life unfolds in the beauty of small moments. These cherished memories not only bring smiles to our faces but also carry valuable lessons. Amidst the hustle of life, it serves as a gentle nudge to appreciate the little things, be grateful for the joy they bring, and find happiness in unexpected corners. These heartwarming episodes are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives, and through them, we discover the profound beauty in the simplicity of each day.
