I don't remember the day very well since it happened when I was 4 to 5 years old. However, my mum has talked about this day a few times, which always makes me smile. 😊

I came back from school, and I had a spelling test that day. After returning home, my mum asked me about the test. I happily shared that it went well, except for one word I knew was wrong. She asked how I could be so sure it was wrong, suggesting that maybe I wasn't entirely certain.

Smiling, I confessed to my mum that I had accidentally peeped into my neighbor's test sheet and saw the correct spelling. However, I chose not to correct mine, as cheating is not good. Seeking affirmation, I asked her, "Mummy, did I do the right thing?" 😊 😊

My mum hugged me, smiled, and told me yes, that I did the right thing and she loves me a lot. ❤️


What did I learn from this Day?

- Innocence of a child, that is just so pure and beautiful.
- The bond between a mother and child, is full of love. Even if I would have cheated that day and come told my mother, she would still have hugged me, smiled, and made me understand the same with love. ❤️
- I was a good kid, listening to my parents and scared of doing the wrong thing since the beginning. 😜 😜


I always like to hear this day's story from my mum's mouth as I can feel the love and pride she carries while telling about it to others. ❤️ ❤️
