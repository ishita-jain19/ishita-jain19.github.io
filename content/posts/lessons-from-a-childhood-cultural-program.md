Today, I want to share a memory that holds a somewhat melancholic place in my recollection. When I was around 11 years old, in standard 6, my school was celebrating its 75th anniversary, and a grand cultural program was in the works. The event promised a plethora of dances, acts, and performances by students across all grades. At that time, I had a keen interest in dramatics and eagerly wished to participate in the play that Standard 6 was slated to perform.

The pivotal moment arrived when the list of students chosen for the standard 6 play was posted. Excitement bubbled within me as I found my name on the list. However, the elation took a swift turn when I discovered the role assigned to me â€“ that of a tree. ðŸ˜ž

Disheartened, I realized my part involved dressing up as a tree, standing on stage, and delivering lines when someone attempted to "cut" me, emphasizing the importance of preserving nature and the environment.

Upon returning home, I shared my disappointment with my parents, who tried to console me and explain the significance of the role. Unfortunately, at that moment, I remained determined to quit the play rather than portray a tree. ðŸ˜ž

Later that day, as I walked down to the playground in our society, a familiar aunty noticed my sadness and inquired about it. I poured out the entire story, clinging to my frustration. Despite her attentive listening and attempts to convey the same comforting words as my parents, I remained resolute, still set on returning to school the next day to resign from the play. ðŸ˜ž

What did I learn from this day?

- My takeaway from the day was to just go out on the stage and be a part of the play rather than getting disheartened by the fact that I was supposed to be a tree. At least I got a chance; there were so many who did not even have the opportunity to be part of it.
