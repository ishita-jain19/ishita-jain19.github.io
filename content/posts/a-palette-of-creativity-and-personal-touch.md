Since recently, I shared my adventures in trying classical singing, let me delve into the memories of some eventful days, recalling the moments when I learned and excelled in various classes and arts during my younger years.❤️🙂

This particular day revolves around my art class, a realm I entered because of my love for creativity, colors, and paints. However, my drawing skills weren't at their peak. So, my mom enrolled me in a class where we learned to draw by observing a picture and then added our own touch through coloring, be it with wax crayons or watercolors. 🎨🎨

I had a tendency to erase a lot while drawing, aiming for perfection in replication. My teacher consistently advised against it, encouraging me to embrace creativity and make personal modifications.❤️

The day etched vividly in my memory was when he instructed us to draw a figurine provided as a reference. As I diligently drew and inevitably started erasing, my teacher noticed and gently nudged me.🙂

I glanced at him, smiled, pondered for a moment, and then returned to my work. After some time, I presented my creation to the teacher, a figurine that closely followed the provided model but with my unique modifications, breathing new life into it. The color palette also bore my personal touch.❤️😄

The joy I felt upon creating and receiving appreciation from my teacher, classmates, and later my parents was unparalleled.❤️

What did I learn from this day?

- While replicating something exactly isn't wrong, adding our own twist or change can infuse new life and meaning, creating a masterpiece.
- Having an exceptional teacher is crucial for fostering a love for learning and receiving guidance to enhance skills for the future.🙂
- As Sadhguru says, "The journey is from being a part of creation to being part of the source of creation or the creator."❤️
