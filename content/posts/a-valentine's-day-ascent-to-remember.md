Over the past 12 years, amidst the multitude of memories, ups, and downs with my husband, there's one particular day that stands out, making our bond stronger. On this Valentine's Day, I feel compelled to share this extraordinary experience, etched with emotions of love and resilience. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

It was the day we conquered Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in South East Asia. The anticipation and excitement were palpable as we embarked on this adventure together. Despite rigorous physical training, the challenge loomed large, especially for me, having undergone ACL surgery in my left knee a year prior to the climb. üò≤
The journey was not just a climb; it was a testament to the strength of our relationship, a shared endeavor to overcome obstacles and reach new heights.‚ù§Ô∏è

As we commenced our ascent, the rocky terrain demanded more than physical endurance; it called for mental fortitude. Each step was a triumph over doubts and fears, a step closer to the pinnacle of our shared achievement. Covering around 3500 meters above sea level on the first day, we took a brief nap and break at the accommodation, continuing the journey through the night to reach the peak by sunset. The exhaustion was real, but so was the determination and love that fueled our every step. üòä

The climb brought forth a mix of emotions‚Äîanticipation, excitement, and fear. Fatigue set in early, and doubts clouded my mind. However, my husband's unwavering patience and encouraging words became my anchor. With each step, he reminded me, 'one step at a time.' In moments of frustration and exhaustion, his smile and reassuring words guided me. He never uttered a word of distress, even though my struggles slowed our pace. His focus was solely on ensuring my successful and joyful completion of the climb. It was then that I realized, no matter the challenges, he would always stand by me. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

What did I learn from this day?

- 'One step at a time' holds the power to lead you anywhere in life.
- Climbing a mountain is predominantly a test of mental fortitude.
- Love knows no bounds and surpasses all challenges. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


This experience instilled gratitude, making me realize the invaluable presence of my husband during one of the toughest times, holding my hand through the journey. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä‚ù§Ô∏è
