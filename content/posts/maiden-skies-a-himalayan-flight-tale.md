Today, I want to share the enchanting memory of my inaugural flight experience. üòõ 
It marked the first time I soared through the skies, taking a small flight from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Pokhara, Nepal‚Äîa brief 20-minute journey with breathtaking views of the majestic Himalayas.

Approximately 23 years ago, there was only one plane operating on this route, a small, few-seater aircraft. üòÉ The airports at both ends lacked modern amenities, relying entirely on manual processes. This trip not only introduced me to air travel but also offered my first glimpse of an airport.

Cruising over mountains, the flight encountered strong winds, creating a bumpy and slightly unnerving experience. Yet, it was my inaugural flight, and the excitement overshadowed any apprehension. Seated in the first row, though not by the window, I had a clear view through the cockpit's glass window, witnessing the mesmerizing panorama. It was simply amazing and awe-inspiring. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è


What did I learn from this day?

- Life's greatest lessons come from trying new things and embracing new experiences.
- Anticipated stories about air travel heightened my excitement, and the breathtaking views made the experience truly worthwhile.
- At the tender age of 12, nature and mountains already held a special place in my heart, bringing me tranquility. ‚ù§Ô∏è
- It's not about the size, appearance, or ambiance; the essence lies in the experience and the joy it brings.

This unforgettable experience, eagerly anticipated by my dad, who often regaled us with tales of his business travels on flights, brought joy and a sense of fulfillment. He mentioned that this unique journey is distinct from the usual experience of flying to distant countries on larger planes, something I eagerly looked forward to in the future.‚ù§Ô∏è
