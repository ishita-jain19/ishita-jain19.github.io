Today, I want to share a heartwarming memory that unexpectedly surfaced in my Google Photos, filling my heart with warmth and joy.

Back when my daughter was just 2 years and a few months old, we were all gathered on the bed one day. Out of the blue, she started playfully mimicking sleep, closing her tiny hands, folding them around her chest, shutting her eyes, and pretending to fall in different directions. My husband and I looked at each other, bursting into laughter, intrigued by this adorable spectacle. We couldn't resist asking her what she was up to.

With a shy smile, she replied, "That's what papa does." 😜 😜 I burst into another fit of laughter, while my husband, a bit perplexed, sought more clarification. Upon further questioning, she elaborated, "Papa closes his eyes, folds his hands, and then falls while sleeping." 😄 ❤️

Oh my God, we couldn't contain our laughter and were in awe of the innocence displayed by our little girl, who must have observed her dad napping in such a manner a few days prior during a flight. We showered her with hugs, kisses, and all the love we could muster, acutely aware that she would grow up fast, turning this day and moment into cherished memories. 😊

We encouraged her to reenact the adorable scenario a few more times, capturing it on video. To this day, that recording resurfaces in my Google Photos, serving as a sweet reminder of her innocence. ❤️ ❤️

What Did I Learn from this Day?

- Kids at any age are incredibly observant and absorb everything happening around them. It was beyond our imagination that she had noticed her dad's unique sleeping style and recreated it so accurately after just a few days. This underscores the importance of being mindful of our words and actions in front of children, ensuring they learn what is right for them.
- The immense love a baby or child brings into one's life is truly amazing. 😊 ❤️
