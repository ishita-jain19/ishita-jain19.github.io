Another delightful culinary adventure unfolded during one of our trip to a quaint Indonesian island, just a 40 to 50-minute ferry ride from Singapore. In 2012 December, we embarked on a weekend getaway to a resort on a charming island of Batam, accompanied by our cousins.😍😍

On a particular day at the resort, we headed to the on-site restaurant for lunch. Craving a vegetarian option, we placed a meticulous order for vegetable fried rice, emphasizing, "No meat, no fish, no pork, no chicken, no egg—just vegetables, please." The waiter attentively nodded and conveyed our order to the chef.😄😄

Anticipation filled the air as we eagerly awaited our meal, wondering if the chef would adhere to our specific dietary request. When the waiter emerged with our plates of fried rice, his beaming face suggested a sense of accomplishment. He proudly declared, "Vegetarian fried rice with no meat, no fish, no pork, no chicken, and no egg." Grateful, we thanked him ❤️ and inquired about the crackers atop the rice, detecting an unfamiliar scent.

With a smile, he casually responded, "Oh, those are just prawn crackers."😄😋😋

Our laughter erupted as we playfully questioned why prawn crackers adorned our supposedly vegetarian dish. The poor lad, caught off guard, looked a bit surprised and disheartened. He swiftly took the plate back, assuring us he would bring a new order without the crackers.😄😄


What did I learn from this day?

- Communication is key, especially when it comes to dietary preferences in unfamiliar places.
- Laughter can turn a culinary mishap into a cherished memory.😄
- Embrace the unexpected during travels; it adds a unique flavor to the experience.❤️

This amusing incident lingers in our memories, a day filled with laughter and a reminder of the unexpected twists that travel can bring.😍😍
