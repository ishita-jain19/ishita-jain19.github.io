After completing my 10th board exams, my maternal side family embarked on an exciting trip to one of my aunt's house in Gujarat—a time filled with joy, new experiences, and the company of beloved cousins.

On this specific day, as my elder cousin brother and I prepared ourselves, the rest of the family readied for the day's exploration. He suggested, "You've been wanting to ride a 2-wheeler, let's take a spin while the others get ready." Filled with excitement for the upcoming bike ride, I eagerly agreed, looking forward to honing my skills for my future two-wheeler adventures back home. 😁😁

We circled around smoothly, but my cautious nature on the roads made me a bit nervous. 😔 After a few rounds, I suggested heading back, but my cousin encouraged one more lap. As we approached, an ambulance appeared, triggering an instinctive fear. In my panic, I gripped the front brake too hard, causing the bike to lurch, and I twisted my knee trying to prevent a fall. 😞😔

My brother was unharmed, but I couldn't stand due to the pain in my left knee. The ambulance took me home, and what was meant to be a joyous day turned into a challenging one. 😵

What did I learn from this day?

- Intuitive signs, like the initial struggle with finding the bike keys and my suggestion to return after the third round, should have been heeded to avoid the accident. ☺️
- Family love instilled a sense of responsibility to protect my older cousin.
- Despite the mishap, the family chose to stay back, showcasing the strength of family bonds. ❤️❤️
- A day that started with joy and laughter during our vacation turned into a nightmare, especially for my mum. However, despite the unexpected turn of events, we managed to find solace and shared some quality time together at home after returning from the hospital. 😇

Thus, with an ACL tear in my left knee, my vacation became a tale of unexpected turns, but resilience prevailed in the face of challenges. 😇
