[{"content":"Since recently, I shared my adventures in trying classical singing, let me delve into the memories of some eventful days, recalling the moments when I learned and excelled in various classes and arts during my younger years.❤️🙂\nThis particular day revolves around my art class, a realm I entered because of my love for creativity, colors, and paints. However, my drawing skills weren’t at their peak. So, my mom enrolled me in a class where we learned to draw by observing a picture and then added our own touch through coloring, be it with wax crayons or watercolors.\nI had a tendency to erase a lot while drawing, aiming for perfection in replication. My teacher consistently advised against it, encouraging me to embrace creativity and make personal modifications.❤️\nThe day etched vividly in my memory was when he instructed us to draw a figurine provided as a reference. As I diligently drew and inevitably started erasing, my teacher noticed and gently nudged me.🙂\nI glanced at him, smiled, pondered for a moment, and then returned to my work. After some time, I presented my creation to the teacher, a figurine that closely followed the provided model but with my unique modifications, breathing new life into it. The color palette also bore my personal touch.❤️😄\nThe joy I felt upon creating and receiving appreciation from my teacher, classmates, and later my parents was unparalleled.❤️\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nWhile replicating something exactly isn’t wrong, adding our own twist or change can infuse new life and meaning, creating a masterpiece. Having an exceptional teacher is crucial for fostering a love for learning and receiving guidance to enhance skills for the future.🙂 As Sadhguru says, “The journey is from being a part of creation to being part of the source of creation or the creator.\"❤️ ","title":"A Palette of Creativity and Personal Touch :heart::art:","uri":"/posts/a-palette-of-creativity-and-personal-touch/"},{"content":"So the day I’m going to talk about today goes back to when I was around 3 to 4 years old. While I don’t have this day etched in my own memory, the vivid recount from my mum and dad paints a picture. ❤️❤️\nDuring that time, my dad was on a field assignment where they camped in tents for 14 days before returning home for the next 14 days. On one such occasion, he took my mum and me to experience tent living. Although I can’t recall the sensations, I’ve seen pictures and heard stories that make this day stand out.😊\nThis particular day featured a massive storm with thunderstorms, fierce winds, and heavy rain. Everyone was instructed to stay inside the sturdy tents, yet, despite their construction, they were still tents, and the experience of being inside during a storm was likely daunting. According to my mum, I was so frightened by the tumultuous events that I nearly fainted. They did their best to keep me occupied amidst the chaos. I was genuinely terrified by the noise and the tent’s movement caused by the gusty winds outside.😢\nWhile I might not remember this incident personally, my parents have recounted it several times, leaving me intrigued about the actual experience.😌\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nEarly childhood experiences, especially those involving fear, can have a lasting impact, even if you don’t recall them firsthand. I, too, still feel a bit uneasy and insecure during thunderstorms, despite not remembering this incident. 😟 Parents play a crucial role in exposing you to life events, as my dad introduced me to tent living even at such a young age, ensuring both a novel experience and my safety during challenging situations. ❤️❤️ ","title":"Whispers of a childhood storm","uri":"/posts/whispers-of-a-childhood-storm/"},{"content":"Today, let me reminisce about a childhood memory when I embarked on the journey of learning classical singing. It was a day that marked a pivotal moment in my musical endeavors.\nAfter a few classes with a talented teacher who played the harmonium, my friend and I, the two eager students, were absorbed in the world of musical notes. However, my friend excelled, showcasing a natural aptitude, while my own progress fell short of expectations.😞\nOn this particular day, I sat down for a rigorous rehearsal of ‘Sa re Ga ma pa,’ enduring a half-hour session with my teacher. Despite my sincere efforts, my notes failed to meet her standards. She questioned my commitment, asking if I was genuinely interested or merely attending because of my mother’s insistence. With a heavy heart, I admitted my struggle and lack of passion for the art.😔\nDisheartened but understanding, my teacher encouraged me to give it a few more attempts. Yet, by the end of that day, we collectively decided that classical singing might not be my forte at that moment.😅\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nExploring various interests is crucial in discovering one’s true passions and strengths. Gratitude fills me when I recall my teacher’s discernment, guiding me to communicate openly with my mother about my true feelings. ❤️ Always express your preferences and concerns, fostering open communication with parents and teachers. It ensures that your energy is invested in endeavors that align with your genuine interests.😊😊 ","title":"A Musical revelation","uri":"/posts/a-musical-revelation/"},{"content":"In our usual fashion, my brother and I engaged in frequent fights and arguments during our younger days. As he grew older, his curiosity often led him to touch and disrupt my meticulously organized belongings, sparking my frustration. One particular day stands out vividly in my memory. 😄\nOn that day, he wreaked havoc on the dollhouse I had been diligently crafting and even broke the head of my beloved Barbie doll—a common target for mischievous brothers, it seems. Fueled by anger, I chased him, but the mischievous little one sought refuge behind our mom. 😅\nAs our fights became a recurring issue, our mom’s patience wore thin. She intervened, asking for an explanation. I presented the evidence, showcasing my Barbie doll without its head. Unable to contain himself, my brother burst into laughter at the sight of the headless Barbie, pushing our mom to her limits. Frustrated, she scolded and then took him to the bathroom, locking him in without lights. 😡\nHis cries of distress pained me deeply, and I couldn’t bear to see him suffer. Tearfully, I apologized to my mom, promising to cease our fights and refrain from complaining about each other. I pleaded with her to release him, explaining my discomfort with his crying inside. Eventually, she relented, opening the door, and my brother, still in tears, retreated to his room. 😢\nI embraced him, expressing my remorse and assuring him that I’d try to handle our issues without involving our parents in the future. He, too, apologized for breaking the Barbie’s head and disrupting the dollhouse, and together, we set about fixing the damage. ❤️\nWhat Did I learn from this Day?\nSibling bonds are a mix of love and occasional annoyance, creating a unique and enduring connection. I discovered the importance of finding resolutions independently instead of immediately involving our parents. Understanding that our parents, though loving equally, resort to different approaches—whether through conversation or punishment—depending on the circumstances and their patience levels. 😄❤️ ","tags":["Sibling"],"title":"Sibling bonds","uri":"/posts/sibling-bonds/"},{"content":"Today, I want to share the enchanting memory of my inaugural flight experience. 😛 It marked the first time I soared through the skies, taking a small flight from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Pokhara, Nepal—a brief 20-minute journey with breathtaking views of the majestic Himalayas.\nApproximately 23 years ago, there was only one plane operating on this route, a small, few-seater aircraft. 😃 The airports at both ends lacked modern amenities, relying entirely on manual processes. This trip not only introduced me to air travel but also offered my first glimpse of an airport.\nCruising over mountains, the flight encountered strong winds, creating a bumpy and slightly unnerving experience. Yet, it was my inaugural flight, and the excitement overshadowed any apprehension. Seated in the first row, though not by the window, I had a clear view through the cockpit’s glass window, witnessing the mesmerizing panorama. It was simply amazing and awe-inspiring. ❤️ ❤️\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nLife’s greatest lessons come from trying new things and embracing new experiences. Anticipated stories about air travel heightened my excitement, and the breathtaking views made the experience truly worthwhile. At the tender age of 12, nature and mountains already held a special place in my heart, bringing me tranquility. ❤️ It’s not about the size, appearance, or ambiance; the essence lies in the experience and the joy it brings. This unforgettable experience, eagerly anticipated by my dad, who often regaled us with tales of his business travels on flights, brought joy and a sense of fulfillment. He mentioned that this unique journey is distinct from the usual experience of flying to distant countries on larger planes, something I eagerly looked forward to in the future.❤️\n","title":"Maiden Skies: A Himalayan Flight Tale","uri":"/posts/maiden-skies-a-himalayan-flight-tale/"},{"content":"Over the past 12 years, amidst the multitude of memories, ups, and downs with my husband, there’s one particular day that stands out, making our bond stronger. On this Valentine’s Day, I feel compelled to share this extraordinary experience, etched with emotions of love and resilience. ❤️❤️\nIt was the day we conquered Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in South East Asia. The anticipation and excitement were palpable as we embarked on this adventure together. Despite rigorous physical training, the challenge loomed large, especially for me, having undergone ACL surgery in my left knee a year prior to the climb. 😲 The journey was not just a climb; it was a testament to the strength of our relationship, a shared endeavor to overcome obstacles and reach new heights.❤️\nAs we commenced our ascent, the rocky terrain demanded more than physical endurance; it called for mental fortitude. Each step was a triumph over doubts and fears, a step closer to the pinnacle of our shared achievement. Covering around 3500 meters above sea level on the first day, we took a brief nap and break at the accommodation, continuing the journey through the night to reach the peak by sunset. The exhaustion was real, but so was the determination and love that fueled our every step. 😊\nThe climb brought forth a mix of emotions—anticipation, excitement, and fear. Fatigue set in early, and doubts clouded my mind. However, my husband’s unwavering patience and encouraging words became my anchor. With each step, he reminded me, ‘one step at a time.’ In moments of frustration and exhaustion, his smile and reassuring words guided me. He never uttered a word of distress, even though my struggles slowed our pace. His focus was solely on ensuring my successful and joyful completion of the climb. It was then that I realized, no matter the challenges, he would always stand by me. ❤️❤️\nWhat did I learn from this day?\n‘One step at a time’ holds the power to lead you anywhere in life. Climbing a mountain is predominantly a test of mental fortitude.

As the evening approached, we gathered on our balcony for a small high tea, sharing laughter over the school gossip. 😄❤️ Following this delightful treat, the girls ventured down for a joyful swim, accompanied by my husband, while I basked in relaxation on a pool chair, surrounded by the melody of chirping birds and the playful sounds of other children.\nIt turned out to be a simple, yet profoundly beautiful day that my daughter fondly recalls, all thanks to a charming little high tea at home. ❤️😊\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nEmbracing simple, unhurried days proves to be a wonderful way to recharge, connect with oneself, family, and nature. ❤️ Devoting time and attention to our little ones can turn an ordinary day into a treasure trove of beautiful memories for a lifetime. ❤️ Beyond family bonds, some connections leave you utterly speechless with their remarkable impact. 😊 ","title":"High Tea, Laughter, and Unforgettable Bonds","uri":"/posts/high-tea-laughter-and-unforgettable-bonds/"},{"content":"After completing my 10th board exams, my maternal side family embarked on an exciting trip to one of my aunt’s house in Gujarat—a time filled with joy, new experiences, and the company of beloved cousins.\nOn this specific day, as my elder cousin brother and I prepared ourselves, the rest of the family readied for the day’s exploration. He suggested, “You’ve been wanting to ride a 2-wheeler, let’s take a spin while the others get ready.” Filled with excitement for the upcoming bike ride, I eagerly agreed, looking forward to honing my skills for my future two-wheeler adventures back home. 😁😁\nWe circled around smoothly, but my cautious nature on the roads made me a bit nervous. 😔 After a few rounds, I suggested heading back, but my cousin encouraged one more lap. As we approached, an ambulance appeared, triggering an instinctive fear. In my panic, I gripped the front brake too hard, causing the bike to lurch, and I twisted my knee trying to prevent a fall. 😞😔\nMy brother was unharmed, but I couldn’t stand due to the pain in my left knee. The ambulance took me home, and what was meant to be a joyous day turned into a challenging one. 😵\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nIntuitive signs, like the initial struggle with finding the bike keys and my suggestion to return after the third round, should have been heeded to avoid the accident. ☺️ Family love instilled a sense of responsibility to protect my older cousin. Despite the mishap, the family chose to stay back, showcasing the strength of family bonds. ❤️❤️ A day that started with joy and laughter during our vacation turned into a nightmare, especially for my mum.

Out of the blue, she started playfully mimicking sleep, closing her tiny hands, folding them around her chest, shutting her eyes, and pretending to fall in different directions. My husband and I looked at each other, bursting into laughter, intrigued by this adorable spectacle. We couldn’t resist asking her what she was up to.\nWith a shy smile, she replied, “That’s what papa does.” 😜 😜 I burst into another fit of laughter, while my husband, a bit perplexed, sought more clarification. Upon further questioning, she elaborated, “Papa closes his eyes, folds his hands, and then falls while sleeping.” 😄 ❤️\nOh my God, we couldn’t contain our laughter and were in awe of the innocence displayed by our little girl, who must have observed her dad napping in such a manner a few days prior during a flight. We showered her with hugs, kisses, and all the love we could muster, acutely aware that she would grow up fast, turning this day and moment into cherished memories. 😊\nWe encouraged her to reenact the adorable scenario a few more times, capturing it on video. To this day, that recording resurfaces in my Google Photos, serving as a sweet reminder of her innocence. ❤️ ❤️\nWhat Did I Learn from this Day?\nKids at any age are incredibly observant and absorb everything happening around them. It was beyond our imagination that she had noticed her dad’s unique sleeping style and recreated it so accurately after just a few days. This underscores the importance of being mindful of our words and actions in front of children, ensuring they learn what is right for them. The immense love a baby or child brings into one’s life is truly amazing. 😊 ❤️ ","title":"The Sweet Imitation of a Toddler's Innocence","uri":"/posts/the-sweet-imitation-of-a-toddlers-innocence/"},{"content":"Today, I’m eager to share a delightful incident from this morning’s breakfast that kept me smiling throughout the day.\nLast night, my daughter fell ill, developing a fever that persisted till morning. Recognizing her discomfort, my husband and I decided to let her rest and skip school for the day. Although she was enthusiastic about the upcoming Chinese New Year celebration at school, featuring her dance performance, we believed a day off would do her good.\nDuring breakfast, I gently inquired about her well-being and expressed regret that she couldn’t attend school. Responding with a frown, she admitted feeling sad about missing the final rehearsal for the dance. Seizing the moment, I playfully informed her about the Mandarin spelling test she also skipped. 😊\nTo our surprise, her eyes sparkled with joy, and she broke into a happy dance, exclaiming how thrilled she was to avoid the spelling test she had forgotten about. Both my husband and I burst into laughter, charmed by the innocence and exuberance in her reaction. ❤️ 😜\nThroughout the day, whenever she spoke to family members, her opening line was a cheerful announcement about being sick yesterday, leading to a day of rest today.

Ready for school, my mum continued her efforts to talk me out of it, but my distress and resolve prevailed. 😞\nUpon reaching school, during a break, I approached the concerned teacher to convey my decision. She greeted me with a smile, seemingly expecting my visit, and invited me to sit with her. Engaging in casual conversation about my daily school life, she eventually commended my audition performance, explaining why I was selected for the role. While acknowledging my discontent, she shared a personal anecdote from her own childhood. She recounted her desire to be an actor, only to be assigned the role of a servant with no lines for her first stage appearance. Despite initial disappointment, she grasped the importance of being part of a play, collaborating with fellow actors, and gracing the stage before an audience. ❤️ ❤️\nHer words resonated with me that day and have lingered in my thoughts ever since. I adopted a perspective that views every opportunity, whether small or grand, as a blessing worth embracing. 😊\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nSometimes, seeking guidance from someone more experienced can offer a fresh and enlightening perspective on a situation. Embracing opportunities, regardless of the roles they entail, can lead to unexpected personal growth and achievements. Grateful for my teacher’s wisdom, I expressed my thanks and decided to remain in the play. Despite portraying a tree, standing tirelessly during rehearsals and the main show, I felt a newfound strength and determination.

When I was around 11 years old, in standard 6, my school was celebrating its 75th anniversary, and a grand cultural program was in the works. The event promised a plethora of dances, acts, and performances by students across all grades. At that time, I had a keen interest in dramatics and eagerly wished to participate in the play that Standard 6 was slated to perform.\nThe pivotal moment arrived when the list of students chosen for the standard 6 play was posted. Excitement bubbled within me as I found my name on the list. However, the elation took a swift turn when I discovered the role assigned to me – that of a tree. 😞\nDisheartened, I realized my part involved dressing up as a tree, standing on stage, and delivering lines when someone attempted to “cut” me, emphasizing the importance of preserving nature and the environment.\nUpon returning home, I shared my disappointment with my parents, who tried to console me and explain the significance of the role. Unfortunately, at that moment, I remained determined to quit the play rather than portray a tree. 😞\nLater that day, as I walked down to the playground in our society, a familiar aunty noticed my sadness and inquired about it. I poured out the entire story, clinging to my frustration. Despite her attentive listening and attempts to convey the same comforting words as my parents, I remained resolute, still set on returning to school the next day to resign from the play. 😞\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nMy takeaway from the day was to just go out on the stage and be a part of the play rather than getting disheartened by the fact that I was supposed to be a tree. At least I got a chance; there were so many who did not even have the opportunity to be part of it.

After returning home, my mum asked me about the test. I happily shared that it went well, except for one word I knew was wrong. She asked how I could be so sure it was wrong, suggesting that maybe I wasn’t entirely certain.\nSmiling, I confessed to my mum that I had accidentally peeped into my neighbor’s test sheet and saw the correct spelling. However, I chose not to correct mine, as cheating is not good. Seeking affirmation, I asked her, “Mummy, did I do the right thing?” 😊 😊\nMy mum hugged me, smiled, and told me yes, that I did the right thing and she loves me a lot. ❤️\nWhat did I learn from this Day?\nInnocence of a child, that is just so pure and beautiful.

After settling down in Singapore following my marriage, about four months later, my husband and I planned a short trip to Melaka, a city in Malaysia approximately 4 hours away by road. This plan coincided with the Christmas holidays, and I was filled with excitement as it marked my first visit to a new country, the fourth overall, including India and Singapore. ❤️ ❤️\nThis day was when we were supposed to embark on this journey, taking an evening bus after finishing our work, to reach the hotel around midnight. Being inexperienced travelers, and this being our first trip, we were starving by the time we reached the hotel. Since we had chosen a small boutique hotel outside the main town to save money while settling in Singapore, there were no open eateries nearby, and the hotel lacked a kitchen for us to order food. After freshening up, we went downstairs hoping to find a store for a quick bite before calling it a night. 😊\nMy excitement peaked when I spotted a street food van in Malaysia, a sight I hadn’t seen for 4 to 5 months since moving out of India to Singapore. Additionally, there was a 24-hour convenience store nearby. 😊 We approached the food van, and to our dismay, it was a burger vendor using ham in the burgers. Being a pure vegetarian from India, it felt awkward to stand there and ask the person to just heat the burger bun with butter separately, especially when he was still using the same pan to heat the ham. My husband, feeling hungry and practical, suggested we go ahead with it, but I refused, saying I couldn’t eat it after witnessing the process. Disagreement ensued, turning into a hangry (hungry + angry) argument. Eventually, we both decided not to eat the bun, quietly went to the store, and managed to get only milk for that moment. 😔 Back in the room, I sipped some milk and went to sleep, while my husband, in his anger, chose to sleep on an empty stomach. 😔\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nSometimes, we really need to think logically and out of the box to make things work. We always cannot just stay very strict on our beliefs and also expect to have a good time without any trouble. Sometimes, a day full of excitement and happiness can turn into a not-so-happy day or a sad day; however, it is up to us how to learn from such days and remember that day in our memories. Days like this can give you some lessons that we can try to use and follow in the future. That was one memorable day. It was also followed by us travelling 20-plus countries together and experiencing amazing things. Today we are better prepared for all future travels, especially if we come across such situations in a country that is not vegetarian friendly. Lastly, we made memories that we now cherish, laugh, and talk about. ❤️ ❤️\n","title":"Culinary Adventures and Lessons Learned","uri":"/posts/culinary-adventures-and-lessons-learned/"},{"content":"Today, I reminisce about a day from our family trip to Darjeeling, a journey embarked upon when I was around 9 years old, accompanied by a delightful group of family friends. This adventure, etched in my childhood memories, has become a cornerstone of my passion for travel — a gift from my parents that I am forever grateful for. ❤️ ❤️\nWe ventured into Darjeeling during the December holidays, immersing ourselves in the freezing cold of a region unaccustomed to winters. For a kid from a part of India who doesn’t typically experience such cold, the trip was a thrilling and occasionally daunting experience. 😲\nThe day I want to share revolves around our plan to visit Tiger Hill early in the morning, eager to witness the captivating sunrise over the Kanchenjunga range and the snow-clad peaks of the eastern Himalayas. ❤️ ❤️ To brave the cold, we bundled up in winter body suits, anticipating the chilly adventure that awaited us.\nDespite our meticulous preparation, there was one underestimated factor—proper footwear. I adorned two socks and a cotton footwear, and the memory of that day isn’t dominated by the breathtaking sunrise but rather by my freezing feet, toes succumbing to frostbite. It was a moment that dampened the experience, not only for me but also for my concerned mum.\nA local, driving us around, noticed the discomfort and advised my mum to head to a good shoe shop for winter boots. This incident served as a lesson learned for future travels, especially considering our upcoming visit to Gangtok, where snow might be in the forecast.\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nPreparation is key, especially when venturing into places with extreme temperatures or unfamiliar weather conditions. (No blame on my mum, as back in those days, information wasn’t as readily accessible.) Not every journey to a breathtaking place guarantees a perfect and awe-inspiring moment. Unexpected circumstances can alter our expectations.

On a particular day, my grandmother, who was a constant source of support during those challenging times, delicately oiled and neatly tied my hair into two braids, offering me with both comfort and a way to minimize hair breakage.\nSitting on the ground, her wise words resonated as she shared, “I understand your dedication to your long, beautiful hair, but considering your current health situation, it might be wise to cut them short. Let your body recover fully, and you can grow them again later when you’re stronger.” The notion of parting with my cherished tresses saddened me; tears welled up, and I sought solace in sharing my distress with my mum.\nUnderstanding my emotional turmoil, my mum gently encouraged me to reflect on it when I felt better and make a decision. Eventually, I realized that the advice, though hard to accept initially, stemmed from genuine concern for my well-being.

In my case, the health challenges paved the way for a transformative healing journey.
