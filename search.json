[{"content":"The day I want to share today is post my move to Singapore. After settling down in Singapore following my marriage, about four months later, my husband and I planned a short trip to Melaka, a city in Malaysia approximately 4 hours away by road. This plan coincided with the Christmas holidays, and I was filled with excitement as it marked my first visit to a new country, the fourth overall, including India and Singapore. ❤️ ❤️\nThis day was when we were supposed to embark on this journey, taking an evening bus after finishing our work, to reach the hotel around midnight. Being inexperienced travelers, and this being our first trip, we were starving by the time we reached the hotel. Since we had chosen a small boutique hotel outside the main town to save money while settling in Singapore, there were no open eateries nearby, and the hotel lacked a kitchen for us to order food. After freshening up, we went downstairs hoping to find a store for a quick bite before calling it a night. 😊\nMy excitement peaked when I spotted a street food van in Malaysia, a sight I hadn’t seen for 4 to 5 months since moving out of India to Singapore. Additionally, there was a 24-hour convenience store nearby. 😊 We approached the food van, and to our dismay, it was a burger vendor using ham in the burgers. Being a pure vegetarian from India, it felt awkward to stand there and ask the person to just heat the burger bun with butter separately, especially when he was still using the same pan to heat the ham. My husband, feeling hungry and practical, suggested we go ahead with it, but I refused, saying I couldn’t eat it after witnessing the process. Disagreement ensued, turning into a hangry (hungry + angry) argument. Eventually, we both decided not to eat the bun, quietly went to the store, and managed to get only milk for that moment. 😔 Back in the room, I sipped some milk and went to sleep, while my husband, in his anger, chose to sleep on an empty stomach. 😔\nWhat did I learn this day?\nSometimes, we really need to think logically and out of the box to make things work. We always cannot just stay very strict on our beliefs and also expect to have a good time without any trouble. Sometimes, a day full of excitement and happiness can turn into a not-so-happy day or a sad day; however, it is up to us how to learn from such days and remember that day in our memories. Days like this can give you some lessons that we can try to use and follow in the future. That was one day and some learning that led us to travel to 20-plus countries together and experience amazing things while still being vegetarian and just being a bit more flexible with each other. That was a day that made me learn and be prepared for future travels if we come across such situations in a country that we are not so much aware of. Lastly, we took this day as a beautiful learning and a memory that we now look back, laugh, and always talk about. ❤️ ❤️\n","title":"Culinary Adventures and Lessons Learned","uri":"/posts/culinary-adventures-and-lessons-learned/"},{"content":"Today, I reminisce about a day from our family trip to Darjeeling, a journey embarked upon when I was around 9 years old, accompanied by a delightful group of family friends. This adventure, etched in my childhood memories, has become a cornerstone of my passion for travel — a gift from my parents that I am forever grateful for. ❤️ ❤️\nWe ventured into Darjeeling during the December holidays, immersing ourselves in the freezing cold of a region unaccustomed to winters. For a kid from a part of India who doesn’t typically experience such cold, the trip was a thrilling and occasionally daunting experience. 😲\nThe day I want to share revolves around our plan to visit Tiger Hill early in the morning, eager to witness the captivating sunrise over the Kanchenjunga range and the snow-clad peaks of the eastern Himalayas. ❤️ ❤️ To brave the cold, we bundled up in winter body suits, anticipating the chilly adventure that awaited us.\nDespite our meticulous preparation, there was one underestimated factor—proper footwear. I adorned two socks and a cotton footwear, and the memory of that day isn’t dominated by the breathtaking sunrise but rather by my freezing feet, toes succumbing to frostbite. It was a moment that dampened the experience, not only for me but also for my concerned mum.\nA local, driving us around, noticed the discomfort and advised my mum to head to a good shoe shop for winter boots. This incident served as a lesson learned for future travels, especially considering our upcoming visit to Gangtok, where snow might be in the forecast.\nWhat did I learn from this day?\nPreparation is key, especially when venturing into places with extreme temperatures or unfamiliar weather conditions. (No blame on my mum, as back in those days, information wasn’t as readily accessible.) Not every journey to a breathtaking place guarantees a perfect and awe-inspiring moment. Unexpected circumstances can alter our expectations. Take a breath, acknowledge it’s okay, and remember that experiences can be recreated. ❤️ Regardless of disappointments or unmet expectations, parents always prioritize their children. ❤️ This day, with its blend of sweetness and bitterness, prompted me to plan with caution for our snowy adventures in Japan last year. 😄\n","title":"A Tale of Frosty Feet and Unexpected Lessons","uri":"/posts/a-tale-of-frosty-feet-and-unexpected-lessons/"},{"content":"Let’s delve into a day etched in my memory, a chapter from when I was around 10 years old, battling a month-long struggle with a urinary infection and Typhoid that left me weakened, with persistent fever and troubling symptoms. 😞 This health ordeal unfolded during a holiday, amidst a wedding celebration, and coincided with my long, painstaking effort to grow and maintain healthy hair locks. ❤️\nAs the infections took a toll on my body, internal weakness set in, leading to weight loss and severe hair fall. On a particular day, my grandmother, who was a constant source of support during those challenging times, delicately oiled and neatly tied my hair into two braids, offering me with both comfort and a way to minimize hair breakage.\nSitting on the ground, her wise words resonated as she shared, “I understand your dedication to your long, beautiful hair, but considering your current health situation, it might be wise to cut them short. Let your body recover fully, and you can grow them again later when you’re stronger.” The notion of parting with my cherished tresses saddened me; tears welled up, and I sought solace in sharing my distress with my mum.\nUnderstanding my emotional turmoil, my mum gently encouraged me to reflect on it when I felt better and make a decision. Eventually, I realized that the advice, though hard to accept initially, stemmed from genuine concern for my well-being. Acknowledging the importance of health over hair, I made the decision to get a haircut. ✂️\nWhat Did I Learn from this Day?\nElders offer wisdom based on experience; their advice may not always align with our desires, but it often carries profound insights for our well-being. Challenging times may bring pain and unpleasant memories, yet seeking the silver lining and understanding that future goodness may emerge is crucial. In my case, the health challenges paved the way for a transformative healing journey. The unconditional love of our grandparents and parents remains a priceless source of comfort and support. ❤️ Once my grandmother finished braiding my hair, my dad captured a picture, now preserved in one of our family photo albums, encapsulating a moment of resilience and the beginning of a healing chapter. ❤️ ❤️\n","title":"A Haircut and Healing Journey","uri":"/posts/a-haircut-and-healing-journey/"},{"content":"In my tender years, around the age of 4 or 5, the anticipation of my aunt’s (my mum’s younger sister) visit filled me with excitement. She was unmarried and young, making her visits particularly special as I looked forward to the pampering and quality time we’d share. ❤️😇\nPrior to her arrival, my mum prepared the guest room. Given our recent move to a new city and the absence of an extra bed, we borrowed a single bed from our thoughtful neighbors. Secretly, my mum cautioned me not to reveal this arrangement to my aunt upon her arrival. 😌\nThe awaited day arrived, and my excitement peaked as I warmly welcomed her. After showing her around, I suggested we both crawl beneath the borrowed bed. Thankfully, her youth and slender frame allowed her to join me in this delightful hiding spot beneath the bed. 😆😍 It was there that I confessed, “Mausi(Aunt), since we didn’t have an extra bed for you, we borrowed this one from our neighbor.”\nTo my surprise, she smiled and embraced me, expressing gratitude for making her feel at home. ❤️ Our shared moment beneath the bed remains etched in my heart, creating a lasting memory that brings a smile whenever I think of her to this day. ❤️❤️\nWhat Did I learn from this Day?\nThe astonishing innocence and purity of a small child’s heart, where honesty and sharing extend to what they perhaps shouldn’t disclose. The profound bond we share with family, as we strive to make them feel happy, welcomed, and comfortable without expecting anything in return. The beautiful blessing of having neighbors and a community always ready to lend a helping hand when needed. In reflecting upon days like these, filled with innocence and warmth, I’m reminded that life unfolds in the beauty of small moments. These cherished memories not only bring smiles to our faces but also carry valuable lessons. Amidst the hustle of life, it serves as a gentle nudge to appreciate the little things, be grateful for the joy they bring, and find happiness in unexpected corners. These heartwarming episodes are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives, and through them, we discover the profound beauty in the simplicity of each day.\n","title":"A Childhood Tale of Aunt's Surprise Visit","uri":"/posts/a-childhood-tale-of-aunts-surprise-visit/"},{"content":"This day I fondly remember holds a special place in my heart.\nAround the age of 4, I visited a friend who had just welcomed a baby brother. Witnessing her sheer joy and playing with the little one left a lasting impression on me. From that moment, a desire took root – I longed for a baby brother of my own.\nExcitedly, I shared my wish with my mother, proposing a visit to the hospital to surprise my dad, who was away at the time. However, my mother wisely explained that it wasn’t as simple as that. If I genuinely wanted a baby brother, she advised me to be a good girl and earnestly pray to God every day for his blessing. ❤️❤️\nWhat Did I learn from this Day?\nEven at the tender age of 4, I grasped the joy that babies bring, and the profound love and happiness they infuse into our lives. The importance of sincere prayer when we truly desire something from our hearts. 😇 Reflecting on that day, I am immensely grateful for that innocent longing that led me to pester my parents. 💕 This desire became a driving force in my life until the day I finally welcomed my baby brother into the world – an experience that remains the happiest moment of my life. 😇❤️\n","title":"The Day I Wished for a Baby Brother","uri":"/posts/the-day-i-wished-for-a-baby-brother/"}]
