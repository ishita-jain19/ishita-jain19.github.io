[{"content":"In my tender years, around the age of 4 or 5, the anticipation of my aunt’s (my mum’s younger sister) visit filled me with excitement. She was unmarried and young, making her visits particularly special as I looked forward to the pampering and quality time we’d share. ❤️😇\nPrior to her arrival, my mum prepared the guest room. Given our recent move to a new city and the absence of an extra bed, we borrowed a single bed from our thoughtful neighbors. Secretly, my mum cautioned me not to reveal this arrangement to my aunt upon her arrival. 😌\nThe awaited day arrived, and my excitement peaked as I warmly welcomed her. After showing her around, I suggested we both crawl beneath the borrowed bed. Thankfully, her youth and slender frame allowed her to join me in this delightful hiding spot beneath the bed. 😆😍 It was there that I confessed, “Mausi(Aunt), since we didn’t have an extra bed for you, we borrowed this one from our neighbor.”\nTo my surprise, she smiled and embraced me, expressing gratitude for making her feel at home. ❤️ Our shared moment beneath the bed remains etched in my heart, creating a lasting memory that brings a smile whenever I think of her to this day. ❤️❤️\nWhat Did I learn from this Day?\nThe astonishing innocence and purity of a small child’s heart, where honesty and sharing extend to what they perhaps shouldn’t disclose. The profound bond we share with family, as we strive to make them feel happy, welcomed, and comfortable without expecting anything in return. The beautiful blessing of having neighbors and a community always ready to lend a helping hand when needed. In reflecting upon days like these, filled with innocence and warmth, I’m reminded that life unfolds in the beauty of small moments. These cherished memories not only bring smiles to our faces but also carry valuable lessons. Amidst the hustle of life, it serves as a gentle nudge to appreciate the little things, be grateful for the joy they bring, and find happiness in unexpected corners. These heartwarming episodes are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives, and through them, we discover the profound beauty in the simplicity of each day.\n","title":"A Childhood Tale of Aunt's Surprise Visit","uri":"/posts/a-childhood-tale-of-aunts-surprise-visit/"},{"content":"This day I fondly remember holds a special place in my heart.\nAround the age of 4, I visited a friend who had just welcomed a baby brother. Witnessing her sheer joy and playing with the little one left a lasting impression on me. From that moment, a desire took root – I longed for a baby brother of my own.\nExcitedly, I shared my wish with my mother, proposing a visit to the hospital to surprise my dad, who was away at the time. However, my mother wisely explained that it wasn’t as simple as that. If I genuinely wanted a baby brother, she advised me to be a good girl and earnestly pray to God every day for his blessing. ❤️❤️\nWhat Did I learn from this Day?\nEven at the tender age of 4, I grasped the joy that babies bring, and the profound love and happiness they infuse into our lives. The importance of sincere prayer when we truly desire something from our hearts. 😇 Reflecting on that day, I am immensely grateful for that innocent longing that led me to pester my parents. 💕 This desire became a driving force in my life until the day I finally welcomed my baby brother into the world – an experience that remains the happiest moment of my life. 😇❤️\n","title":"The Day I Wished for a Baby Brother","uri":"/posts/the-day-i-wished-for-a-baby-brother/"},{"content":"Greetings, everyone!\nI’m Ishita Jain, originally from India but proud to call Singapore my home for over a decade.
